# d3c
<h1>A controller-template for TouchOSC - intended for DJ-usage on Ableton</h1>

<h2>Introducing the d3c - and first of all: what it is NOT...</h2>
<p>Let's get the facts straight first: the d3c-controller is NOT a standalone (neither software- or hardware-based) MIDI (DJ-)controller!</p>

<h2>"TL;DR -Cut to the chase: What is the d3c-controller then...?"</h2>
<p>The d3c-controller is a template made for - and to be run on - TouchOSC's (IMHO) excellent app-software for iOS and Android by hexler.net, which enables a modular OSC and MIDI control surface for - in this case and for now - iPads and Android-based 10.1 tablets! Intended to control Ableton for DJ-usage and -purposes, this template's purpose is to turn an iPad or Android-tablet into a DJ-mixer, from where one can PFL-, launch-/stop- and mix tracks on Ableton (via MIDI), as if it was a "regular" hardware-controller!</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can also set/adjust/change the set's current-running BPM on-the-fly, and there's also a three-band EQ including kill-buttons for each band, too (note: only implemented on the expanded-version of the template).</p>

<p>Now - let's move on...</p>

<h2>Getting started:</h2>
<p>After purchasing the TouchOSC-app, youâ€™ll then be needing the following pieces of free software listed below.</p>
<h3>Android/iOS:</h3>
<p><a href="https://hexler.net/software/touchosc-android" title="Get the additional TouchOSC-software from here..." target="_blank">https://hexler.net/software/touchosc-android</a></p>

<p>Then scroll down to get hold of the required software to get the template(s) installed: 
<ul>
<li>TouchOSC Editor</li>
<li>TouchOSC Bridge</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Getting things setup and running:</h2>

<h3>Specifically in this case, regarding the templates:</h3>

<h3>Note to Android/Windows-users:</h3>
<p>Admitted, almost every manual/how-to/tutorial out there for TouchOSC seem more iOS-centric, and manuals/how-tos/tutorials explicitly for TouchOSC for 'droids and/or running on Windows are somewhat lacking in numbers out on the interweb!<br>
However setting up the TouchOSc on an Android-tablet is a breeze (as there isn't that much difference in this case between iOS and Android, apart from the slight differences of their GUI), and so is getting it to talk with Ableton running on Windows, IMHO!</p>
<p>But if all fails: Either download and install MIDIYoke and follow the instructions here: <a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4544922" title="Setup tutorial for TouchOSC on an Android Phone..." target="_blank">https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4544922</a></p>
<p>(Please note the link above is of an older date...)</p>  

<p>Or just do as I did, download and install TouchOSC Bridge and let TouchOSC walk you through the process (also aided by the combo of the links listed above) and you'll be up and running in no time...!</p> 

<h2>Regarding d3c and Ableton 10.x</h2>
<p>Since the release of Ableton ver. 10, I've noticed some rather irritating bugs; I seriously doubt, it's Ableton's or Hexler's fault</p>
<p>Although, I'm well-aware of these occuring bugs, I haven't had the opportunity to find out what's causing these - let alone fix them!<br> If any of you touchOSC-users out there might know, what might be causing this bug, then please by all means contact me A.S.A.P.!<br> But otherwise I have no current plans regarding me performing a bug-hunt and a fix of the d3c-templates - as for now!</p>
<p>Just sayin'...</p>

<h2>&quot;Fun fact...&quot;</h2>
<p>Here's actually the first set that I've mixed with the prototype of the basic-version of d3c-template (using an Android 10.1-tablet) - ENJOY!</p> <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/dee3/live-from-an-island-remastered/" title="The Live From An Island set at Mixcloud" target="_blank">https://www.mixcloud.com/dee3/live-from-bornholm/</a>
